# MachineLearning 1
GitHub repository for Machine Learning Project 1 & 2 from EMJMDNP

Group formed by Alan Ricardo Cíntora de la Cruz, Guillermo Ortega Ureta, Iván Mozún Mateo.

The project no1 is explained in Project1.pdf file and the report is divided into two jupyter notebooks:
- Machine Learning Project 1 - Franke function.ipynb
- Machine Learning Project 1 - Boston Housing dataset.ipynb

The project no2 is divided in two jupyter notebooks:
- Machine Learning Project 2 - Franke Function NN.ipynb 
- Machine Learning Project 2 - Hotel Reservations.ipynb
The first notebook incorporates PCA and NN to the analysis of Franke function done in project 1 whereas the second one does a study on a classification problem with a Hotel Reservation dataset using 3 different models: logistic regression, k nearest neighbors and NN MLP classifier.
